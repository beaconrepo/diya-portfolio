            <h3>AP Planner </h3>
            <p>This webpage is designed to help students prepare for AP exams. The AP Exam Planner provides a dynamic platform for students to tailor their AP exam preparation. Students can configure their subjects for an academic year, enabling a focused approach. A key feature is the ability to create detailed study plans, which often incorporate the percentage weight of different topics within each subject. This helps students allocate study time effectively, prioritizing areas with higher importance. Within these plans, students can create individual tasks, breaking down their revision into manageable steps, tracking progress, and ensuring comprehensive coverage of all necessary material before their AP exams.
